		<h3>Composition of the Gut Microbiome Influences Production of Sulforaphane-Nitrile and Iberin-Nitrile from Glucosinolates in Broccoli Sprouts</h3>
		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>Isothiocyanates, such as sulforaphane and iberin, derived from glucosinolates (GLS) in cruciferous vegetables, are known to prevent and suppress cancer development. GLS can also be converted by bacteria to biologically inert nitriles, such as sulforaphane-nitrile (SFN-NIT) and iberin-nitrile (IBN-NIT), but the role of the gut microbiome in this process is relatively undescribed and SFN-NIT excretion in humans is unknown. An ex vivo fecal incubation model with in vitro digested broccoli sprouts and 16S sequencing was utilized to explore the role of the gut microbiome in SFN- and IBN-NIT production. SFN-NIT excretion was measured among human subjects following broccoli sprout consumption. The fecal culture model showed high inter-individual variability in nitrile production and identified two sub-populations of microbial communities among the fecal cultures, which coincided with a differing abundance of nitriles. The Clostridiaceae family was associated with high levels, while individuals with a low abundance of nitriles were more enriched with taxa from the Enterobacteriaceae family. High levels of inter-individual variation in urine SFN-NIT levels were also observed, with peak excretion of SFN-NIT at 24 h post broccoli sprout consumption. These results suggest that nitrile production from broccoli, as opposed to isothiocyanates, could be influenced by gut microbiome composition, potentially lowering efficacy of cruciferous vegetable interventions</p>
